# Personal website
----
This is initial skeleton of my perosnal website(WIP) created using the [Hexo](https://hexo.io/) framework and is hosted with Firebase. This will update frequently.

### Installation
----
Detailed instructions on how to build and deploy website using hexo and deploy to firebase will follow in an upcoming blog post (I am moving all my repos to git, it will take a few days).

For now, follow these instructions to run locally (make sure you have Hexo CLI installed globally):
```sh
# clone the repo
$ git clone [https://github.com/vijay-joshi/personal-website.git]

# change to directory
$ cd personal-website

# install dependencies
$ npm install

# this will serve the website locally at http://localhost:4000/
$ hexo serve

# generate static files to public directory which you can host to any host
$ hexo generate
```
